	<p>We're going to let you be the robot for a few minutes. It might take a moment to load, please be patient. Try to
		see if you can test out everything we've told you
		about, including breaking the robot. If you break the robot, we'll let you play with another one in a different
		mine. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move around. When you're comfortable, hit the
		start button to start giving the robot feedback.</p>
