    <p>Today we're trying to help a mining robot understand how well it's doing its job. We're going to show you two
        pictures or videos of the robot and ask you which one is better.</p>

    <p>The robot can move around the mine and pick up diamonds. When the robot has picked up all the diamonds, it can
        leave through the door.<br>

    </p>
    <p>But watch out! If something falls on the robot, it will break, and you'll have to start over in a new mine.<br>

    <p>You can push boulders around if there's an empty space for them to go.<br>

    <p>Boulders and diamonds can slip off of each other if there's an empty space to the side.<br>

    </p>

    <p>Your job is to tell the robot when it's doing better or worse. Here are some things you might want to consider:
    </p>
    <p>The robot's job is mine for diamonds. It's better for the robot to mine a diamond than not to.<br>

    </p>
    <p>The robot is very expensive. It's worse if the robot explodes.<br>

    </p>
    <p>There is dark brown mud in the mine. It's worse for the robot to go through mud than dirt.<br>

    </p>
    <p>When the robot has picked up all the diamonds, it can go home through the door. It's better for the robot to go
        home than to stay in the mine.<br>
