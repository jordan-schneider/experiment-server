        <p>You are being invited to participate in a research study titled &ldquo;Computational behavior in the context of human reactions, instructions, and feedback&rdquo;. This study is being done by Jordan Schneider and Dr. Scott Niekum from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p>

        <p>Why are we doing this research study?<br>
        The purpose of this research study is for an AI to learn what a human wants the AI to do by asking them different kinds of questions.</p>

        <p>Who can participate in this research study?<br>
        All Mechanical Turk users with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox 61+, Edge 18+, Safari, Opera 13+) can participate in this research study.</p>

        <p>What will I be asked to do and how much time will it take?<br>
        If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to participate in a brief simulation of a mining robot, and then be presented with videos of the simulated robot operating in the mine and asked which of the behaviors in the videos you prefer. It will take you approximately 30 minutes to complete.</p>

        <p>Will being in this research study help me in any way?<br>
        You may not directly benefit from this research; however, we hope that your participation in the study may help us better design AI systems to understand what humans want them to do.</p>

        <p>What are my risks of being in this research study?<br>
        We believe there are minimal risks associated with this research study; however, a risk of breach of confidentiality always exists and we have taken the steps to minimize this risk as outlined in a section below.</p>

        <p>How will my personal information be protected?<br>
        To the best of our ability your answers in this study will remain confidential. We will store your preferences about these videos, how long you took to give each preference, and an Amazon Mechanical Turk payment code that we generate for you. We will not store any other identifying or demographic information about you. We will minimize any risks by storing your information only temporarily on the Heroku Cloud Application Platform, and permanently on Amazon&rsquo;s Simple Storage Service, the encrypted hard drive in the personal laptop of the experimenter and other encrypted drives owned by owned by the Safe, Confident, and Aligned Learning + Robotics (SCALAR) Lab at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.</p>

        <p>Will I be given any money or other compensation for being in this research study?<br>
        You will be paid 37.5 cents USD per preference given, for a total of $7.50 for 20 questions. For partial payment please email us at <a href="mailto:multimodal.reward.experiment@gmail.com">multimodal.reward.experiment@gmail.com</a> with the time you started the study and the number of preferences you gave.</p>

        <p>What happens if I say yes, but I change my mind later?<br>
        You do not have to be in this study if you do not want to. If you agree to be in the study, but later change your mind, you may drop out at any time. There are no penalties or consequences of any kind if you decide that you do not want to participate.</p>

        <p>Who can I talk to if I have questions?<br>
        If you have questions about this project or if you have a research-related problem, you may contact the researchers, Jordan Schneider and Dr. Scott Niekum at <a href="mailto:multimodal.reward.experiment@gmail.com">multimodal.reward.experiment@gmail.com</a> . If you have any questions concerning your rights as a research subject, you may contact the University of Massachusetts Amherst Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) at (413) 545-3428 or <a href="mailto:humansubjects@ora.umass.edu">humansubjects@ora.umass.edu</a> .</p>
